#Transitioning_Into_InfoSec#

So many people in Information Security create resources for students transitioning into the industry, but the struggle is to share them to Academia and anyone else trying to start out. Compiling those and sharing with Academia is the goal of this resource

Key Points:
* Go to InfoSec Meetups
* Go to Local InfoSec Conferences (Many are under $25) - Network
* Volunteer at Infosec Conferences 
* Join in infosec conversations on twitter
* Play Infosec Challenges
* Assist a open source project on github - both beta testing and documentation are huge
